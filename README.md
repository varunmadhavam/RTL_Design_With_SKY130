The workshop intends to cover in detail the step marked in red, that is **logic synthesis**

## What is logic synthesis .!?
Logic sysnthesis is the process of translating the a RTL Desing, which is the behavioral represntation of a specifications, usaully written in some HDL language like verilog, to a gate level netlist. The netlist contains a set of gates and connections between them as per the description. ......
