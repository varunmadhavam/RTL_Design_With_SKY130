The workshop intends to cover in detail the step marked in red, that is **logic synthesis**

## What is logic synthesis .!?
Logic sysnthesis is the process of translating your RTL Desing, which is the behavioral represntation of some specifications, usaully written in a HDL language like verilog, to a gate level netlist. The netlist contains a set of gates and connections between them as per the description. ......

## Why is it important .!?

# Day1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis
1. Setting Up the Lab.
    - Login to your lab instance and in our home directory create a directory named VLSI.
